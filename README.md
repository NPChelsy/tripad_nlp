# Tripadvisor Review Analysis

In recent years, the use of NLP has become widely common in marketing and sales analysis. With the amount of non-numeric data available in the form of comments, reviews, and survey responses, utilizing NLP tools can help organizations extract valuable information.

The goal of this project is to utilize NLP tools in Python to analyze customer reviews and identify trends and potential problems evident in the reviews.
